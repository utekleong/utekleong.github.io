I am a Psychology PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Associate Professor Ryan Hong](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/psyhysr/).

Broadly, I am interested in the study of how personality and individual differences influence physical and mental health outcomes. For my PhD research, I am currently investigating the relationships between cognitive vulnerabilities and internalizing psychopathology using psychopathological networks. During my free time, I enjoy tending to my tropical houseplants, listening to melodic hardcore, and taking walks with my beautiful fianc√©e.

If you would like to contact me, please drop me an email at [utek@outlook.com](mailto:utek@outlook.com).
