I am a Psychology PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Associate Professor Ryan Hong](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/psyhysr/).

Broadly, I am interested in the study of how individual differences influence physical and mental health outcomes. For my PhD research, I am currently investigating the relationships between a core transdiagnostic vulnerability and internalizing psychopathology using psychological network modelling. During my free time, I enjoy tending to my tropical houseplants, playing Magic the Gathering, listening to melodic hardcore, and taking walks with my beautiful wife.

If you would like to contact me, please drop me an email at [utek\@outlook.com](mailto:utek@outlook.com).
