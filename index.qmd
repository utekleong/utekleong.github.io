Hello there! I am Utek, a Psychology PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore, advised by [Associate Professor Ryan Hong](https://profile.nus.edu.sg/fass/psyhysr/).

Broadly, I am interested in the study of how individual differences influence physical and mental health outcomes. For my PhD research, I am currently investigating the relationships between a core transdiagnostic vulnerability and internalizing psychopathology using psychological network modelling.

During my free time, I enjoy tending to my tropical houseplants, playing Magic the Gathering, listening to melodic hardcore, and taking walks with my beautiful wife.
