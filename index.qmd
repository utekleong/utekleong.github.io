Hello there! I am Utek. Broadly, I am interested in the study of how individual differences influence physical and mental health outcomes. For my PhD research, I investigated the relationships between a core transdiagnostic vulnerability and internalizing psychopathology using psychological network modelling.

During my free time, I enjoy tending to my tropical houseplants, playing degenerate Magic The Gathering combo decks, listening to melodic hardcore, and taking walks with my beautiful wife.
